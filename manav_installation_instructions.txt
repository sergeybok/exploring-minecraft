1. 
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo-challenge
cd malmo-challenge
pip install -e .

2. brew install boost --with-python 

3. brew install boost-python ffmpeg xerces-c mono 

3.5 To install libxerces on a Ubuntu machine use the following command::
	sudo apt-get install libxerces-c-3.1

4. sudo brew cask install java
This doesn't work as can't use sudo for brew

5. export MALMO_XSD_PATH=/Users/manavchoudhary/USI/1sem/Deep_Learning_Lab/DL_Lab_project/malmo/Malmo-0.30.0-Mac-64bit_withBoost/Schemas

6. export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_152.jdk/Contents/Home

7. cd Malmo-0.30.0-Mac-64bit_withBoost/Minecraft
   ./launchClient.sh

8. cd Malmo-0.30.0-Mac-64bit_withBoost/Python_Examples
   /usr/bin/python run_mission.py

9. Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/xerces-c/lib/libxerces-c-3.1.dylib

    From the website ::::
    https://archive.apache.org/dist/xerces/c/3/sources/

    I downloaded the file, :: xerces-c-3.1.4.zip, then unzip in the project directory or wherever
    then in the unzipped directory, do the following::::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

    I guess this installs the xerces 3.1 version, because after this the run_mission.py works
    but the /usr/local/opt/xerces-c/lib/ directory still doesn't have any file named libxerces-c-3.1.dylib, though somehow it works now.

10.  cd Minecraft
     ./launchClient.sh

11.   cd Python_Examples
      python run_mission.py

12. Installing OpenCV
     brew install opencv
     echo /usr/local/opt/opencv/lib/python2.7/site-packages >> /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/opencv2.pth

     Do::::
      ---- Go to the site-packages directory of the default system python----
     cd  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
     rm cv2.so
     sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/opencv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so


	The following method doesn't work and gives the error "ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import"
      ---- Go to the site-packages directory of the default system python----
      ---- To find the directory where the opencv got installed by brew, use 'ls' on the /usr/local/opt/opencv directory
      ---- To find the directory where the site-packages of default python is located use the instruction #13.------
      cd '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/'
      sudo ln -s /usr/local/opt/opencv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so cv2.so

13. Finding the 'site-packages' folder of the default python of Mac OS sierra:
	/usr/bin/python (opens the interactive interpreter)
	 import sys
	print sys.path
	['', '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg', '..................]

	So the path is '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/'

14. To install xerces in a specified directory instead of the default directory, do the following:::

	./configure --prefix=/..../..../..../
	make
	make install

15. To install tensorflow in the native python of MacOS do the following:
       sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install --upgrade tensorflow
